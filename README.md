This project is for testing Python script as a black box.

Recently I am doing coding challenges in Hankerrank. However, Hankerrank online editor is not suitable for writing large programs.
Besides, local IDE cannot run test cases like Hankerrank online editor. 

In this project, I have built a test environment locally which achieves similar function as Hankerrank online editor.

This sample program is an addition which takes two input numbers and return output.

In blackBoxTest1.py, the method is native run.
In blackBoxTest2.py, the method is Popen.
